# AlHosLetMeIn

Please note that this project has not been completed yet. Documentation is still to come.

This project is designed to show COVID-19 vaccination status in augmented reality, 
by leveraging the Microsoft Hololens. 

The Hololens streams frames from the camera sensor to an API server that can leverage
GPU acceleration to speed up and more accurately find faces in images. The API server
sends back face locations and alhosn status. 

The United Arab Emirates uses an app called
Al Hosn to verify vaccination and PCR status for each citizen. Though not connected
to the official database, this proof of concept could easily be implemented in a real-life scenario.
